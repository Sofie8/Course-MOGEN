## What did Barbara McClintock discover?
What did Barbara McClintock discover in the early 1940's when looking at the patched colors of corn kernels, and for which she received the noble prize in Medicine in 1983? [video](https://youtu.be/ZHho1c-EbTY). Can you explain this phenomenon with a mechanism of gene transfer from the theory lessons?

## Transposable Elements
A Transposable Element (TE), sometimes called a "jumping gene", is short piece of DNA capable of moving from one location in the genome to another.
A transposable element can transpose:  

- to a different spot on the same chromosome  

- to a different chromosome  

TEs are found in almost all living organisms. TEs can comprise a large proportion of an entire eukaryotic genome. The human genome is more than 50% transposon or transposon remnants!

TEs can be critical to both the function and evolution of genomes.
TEs can be classified as:  

Class I: "copy and paste"  
- retrotransposons

Class II: "cut and paste":  
-DNA transposons  
-autonomous  
-non-autonomous  

If you want to know more about Barbara's work you can later listen to this [podcast](https://www.cshl.edu/dark-matter-genome-pt-1/)


## Retrotransposons

A Class I TE (= retrotransposon) uses a "copy and paste" mechanism to transpose.

A retrotransposon:  

-contains a gene encoding reverse transcriptase  
-never leaves its DNA location  
-is transcribed into an RNA intermediate.  

The new retrotransposon inserts at another target site in the DNA.  
This creates a new copy of the retrotransposon, so one resides at the original location a new location Retrotransposons can proliferate and insert many times in a genome.

Eukaryotes can have more reverse transcriptase genes than any other exome genes!

There are two types of retrotransposons, write them below:

## Retrotransposons in Eukaryotic Genomes: LINEs and SINEs

Large genomes have tremendous numbers of transposable elements. Some may be composed mostly of transposable elements.

More than half of the human genome consists of:  
-long interspersed elements (LINEs)  
-short interspersed elements (SINEs)  
Most no longer transpose, but can still be identified by the presence of flanking inverted repeats.

A vast number are found only in introns. These are excised and never translated. They are evolutionary relics rendered harmless by their benign insertion location the host's regulatory mechanisms

To which type of retrotransposons do LINE and SINE belong respectively?

## SINE
The most abundant SINE in the human genome contains a target site for the Alu (from *Arthrobacter luteus*) restriction enzyme. This SINE is named the Alu element.

Alu elements comprise more than 10% of the human genome.  There are more than one million copies of various Alu fragments in every human genome.

Sometimes the word "selfish" DNA is used for these sequences:    
-It spreads by forming additional copies of itself within the genome.  
-It makes no specific contribution to the reproductive success of its host.  
-It may be neutral or maladaptive.  


## Searching LINEs and SINE in Eukaryotic genomes
In this excercise you are going to explore yourself which TEs can be found in e.g. human, monkey, fish.
Go to the [RepeatMasker database](http://www.repeatmasker.org/genomicDatasets/RMGenomicDatasets.html)  
Chose an organism of interest and have a look at the genome fraction that LINEs and SINEs and other transposable elements make up. Look at species differences.  

We are going to explore another database, [DFam of repetitive DNA families](https://www.dfam.org/home)
Perform keyword search and try to look up some LINE, SINE, alu elements in a species you like.  Obtain additional information, such as classification, description, sequence structure. Describe one.

## TEs and diseases
A few human DNA TEs can still transpose. Some are associated with specific diseases:  
-Hemophilia A (three different LINE insertions in clotting factor VIII gene)  
-Hemophilia B (insertion into the clotting factor IX gene)  
-Neurofibromatosis (Alu insertion into the NF1 gene  
-Breast Cancer (Alu insertion into the BRCA2 gene)  
Can you find another example?
