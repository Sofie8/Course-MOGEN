## Transposable Elements in Bacteria

Two basic types of TEs are known in bacteria:

-Insertion Sequence (IS) elements  
-transposons  

## IS elements
Insertion Sequences are short pieces of DNA that move about in the genome.  
IS element insertion disrupts gene function.  
All genes downstream from insertion in an operon will be disrupted.  
The mutation is said to be polar.  
All IS elements are flanked by inverted repeats.  

## Transposons
In Japanese hospitals in the 1950's a strain of Shigella bacteria appeared that was resistant to a wide array of antibiotics. The multiple-drug resistance phenotype was inherited as a single package. Other bacterial species could obtain this resistance via transformation. The genes were being spread via a self-replicating episome that could
replicate freely in the cytoplasm or insert into the bacterial chromosome (and replicate with it) It was later dubbed a transposon.

A bacterial transposon can:  
- excise from a host gene without disrupting it (precise excision)  
- excise and take some host DNA along with it (imprecise excision)  


Imprecise excision is far more common than precise excision.  

## Excercise searching transposons, IS in bacteria
Use the [NCBI database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and search for transposons and insertion elements in:  
- *Pseudomonas putida* F1  
- *Pseudomonas putida* HS1  

What is the size of the bacteria genome of *Pseudomonas putida* F1?
Compare with other bacterial strains?  
Can you explain differences in genome size based on lifestyle? where was the bacteria isolated from? Soil, gut, nodule?  

Was your bacteria infected in the past with a phage? Use the [Phaster database](http://phaster.ca/)  

Select a bacterium of interest, and search if it has CRISPRcas9 systems using this [database](https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/MainDb/StrainList)? How many phage elements has the strain incorporated?
