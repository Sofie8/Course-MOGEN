## Cre-Lox and FLEx technology
The Cre-Lox system is an ingenious system of site-specific recombination and has been successfully used in biotechnology to alter gene function. 
Refresh your knowledge about Cre-LoxP by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I21NmFq4F8A), and how FLEx technology
by Applied Biological Materials has adapted this system.

&nbsp;

## Exercise 1
1) Explain the role of Cre recombinase in the Cre-Lox system. How does it enable conditional gene expression?
2) Compare the FLEx switch to traditional Cre-Lox systems. What advantages does FLEx offer? Tip: Discuss how the orientation of LoxP sites affects the gene switching mechanism in the FLEx system. What happens during the excision and inversion events?
4) Design an experiment where you would use the FLEx system to study a specific gene in mice. Describe your hypothesis and methods.

## GATE-WAY cloning 
Just like the cre-lox FLEx switch technology, another company, INVITROGEN, has introduced the GATEWAY Cloning Technology. The Gateway cloning method, developed by Invitrogen, is an in vitro version of the integration and excision recombination reactions that take place when lambda phage infects bacteria. In vivo, these recombination reactions are facilitated by the recombination of attachment sites from the phage (attP) and the bacteria (attB). As a result of recombination between the attP and attB sites, the phage integrates into the bacterial genome flanked by two new recombination sites (attL-left- and attR-right-, Figure 1). Under certain conditions, the attL and attR sites can recombine, leading to the excision of the phage from the bacterial chromosome and the regeneration of attP and attB sites.

In short, Gateway Cloning Technology is an easy-to-use system for cloning and subcloning DNA segments (e.g. genes of interest), facilitating gene functional analysis, protein expression, and the integration of technology platforms. One can also readily clone PCR products into so-called Gateway "Entry" vectors. To shuttle inserts from one vector to another, the Gateway Cloning Technology uses bacteriophage lambda-based site-specific recombination. There is no need to use restriction enzymes and ligase to subclone inserts.

Gateway vectors contain modified versions of the att sites so that scientists can easily clone in their desired DNA sequences. Gateway technology relies on the two reactions described below:

The BP Reaction takes place between the attB sites flanking the insert and the attP sites of the donor vector. This reaction is catalyzed by the BP Clonase enzyme mix and generates the entry clone containing the DNA of interest flanked by attL sites. As a byproduct of the reaction, the ccdB gene is excised from the donor vector.

The LR Reaction takes place between the attL sites of the generated entry clone and the attR sites of the destination vector. This reaction is catalyzed by the LR Clonase enzyme mix. As a result, an expression clone with the DNA of interest flanked by attB sites is generated. As in the BP reaction, a DNA fragment containing the ccdB gene is excised from the destination vector. 

Once the BP and/or LR reactions are performed, the next step is to transform competent E. coli cells and select the positive clones. The entry clone and destination vector carry different antibiotic resistance markers (indicated here by plasmid color), allowing you to easily select for the expression clone. 

You can read more about GATEWAY-CLONING on the [INVITROGEN website](https://www.thermofisher.com/be/en/home/life-science/cloning/gateway-cloning/gateway-technology.html).

## Visualisation of gate-way cloning
We are going to search ourself a gateway destination vector on the [INVITROGEN's webpage](https://www.thermofisher.com/be/en/home/life-science/cloning/gateway-cloning/gateway-technology.html). Which types of destination vectors do you find. Select one, e.g. the [yeast two hybrid system](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/PQ1000101#/PQ1000101) and [read](https://www.singerinstruments.com/resource/yeast-2-hybrid/) what you can study with it.

&nbsp;


## Exercise 2
Write down 4 different destination vectors:

What can you do with it?   
For example have also a look at the [VIB-UGent website](https://gatewayvectors.vib.be/) for gate-way vectors for plant transformation and their [applications](https://www.psb.ugent.be/).
