## CRISPRcas9

Refresh what the CRISPRcas9 system does by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YKFw2KZA5o).

Give 3 examples of how you can use CRISPRcas9 to introduce genetic changes in a gene?
  
Give an application of CRISPRcas9.

## Prime editing
There is a new tool on the market called Prime editing:

Read this short [paper](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/10/new-prime-genome-editor-could-surpass-crispr) and explain the main differences, improvements of the Prime editing system compared to CrISPRcas9.

## Genetic diversity, evolution, genome size
Can you discuss evolution in genome size with the methods we have seen to exchange genetic material?

## Difference between knock-out/in and knock-down: when to use CRISPR, when RNAi?
Which technology is most suitable for performing a complete knockout of a gene, versus a reduction in the gene expression (knockdown)?
Have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Z4u0DKbx0).  
Is it possible to do RNAi in bacteria?
