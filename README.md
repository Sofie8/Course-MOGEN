## Learning outcomes
By the end of the RC, you should be able to:  

- Explain what GATEWAY Cloning Technology is and on which natural mechanism it is based. You know that there are different GATEWAY expression vector systems, and you can give an example of how GATEWAY cloning is used.  

- You can understand and discuss transposable elements in eukaryotes, and how it has contributed to genetic diversity  

- You know how to use web-based databases for searching transposons, IS, phages, CRISPR in bacteria, fungi, plant and animal cells  

- You can schematise the process of CRISPRcas9, give an example of an application, and you can discuss prime editing.
